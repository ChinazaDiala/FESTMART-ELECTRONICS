### Tools
- excel - Data cleaning
- Power BI - Creating reports

### Data cleaning/preparation
in the initial data preparation phase we performed the following task;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting
4. Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
5. Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
6. Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
